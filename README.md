## Focus-timer has multiple iterations of chrome extentions with the overall goal of improving how people can use the chrome browser

Distraction blocker let users block website that they consider helpful to block. For me this includes websites like Youtube, and chess.com
The Distraction blocker can be found in the publishing folder, it is also in the [chrome extention store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/distraction-blocker/gigiekecpijokpijbabheahcnpfchhga?hl=en&authuser=0)


Focus timer lets users set a timer on a spesfic page. It will play a success noise if they stay for the time the set, and a failure noise if they leave before then
The Focus time can be found in the old folder as the agencyAssistant1.2 it is also in the [chrome extention store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/agency-assistant/pbcoffnbffloddpmembnpojpngdpgcbo?hl=en&authuser=0)
